# Roll of Fate — Next.js + Tailwind (pure CSS skin preserved)

This is your app migrated to **Next.js (App Router)** with **Tailwind** configured.  
All functionality and visual CSS classes are preserved exactly; only the project scaffolding changed.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Images live under `public/images/`. Replace the placeholder JPGs with your real assets if you have them:
- `/public/images/ranger-active.jpg`
- `/public/images/wolf-active.jpg`
- `/public/images/wolf-inactive.jpg`
- `/public/images/bg.jpg`

Your original styles are in `app/globals.css` (after the Tailwind layers). The page component is in `app/page.tsx`.
